Be careful interepreting any of these.  I kept them becasue they were
of interest to me but the builds varied during these runs.  The native
compiler was not always the same (and even clang vs. gcc makes a huge
difference).  The X64 runs were not done on machines that were heavily
controlled.

There's a lot of room for error here and it's as much a measure of
what was happening in the code as it was edited as anything else.
