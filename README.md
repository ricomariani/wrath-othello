# Waterloo CSC 1987 Othello Entry

I kept this code around over the years and I thought I would post it as a warning to others.

If you want to know what you get a decent coder tries to write an Othello program from scratch in about 16 hours straight (all night)
for tournament the next day this is it.  

What can I say, it could be worse.

I had to make a few very minor changes to reduce warnings from ridiculous to just awful.
