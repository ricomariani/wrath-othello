# Waterloo CSC 1987 Othello Entry

I kept this code around over the years and I thought I would post it as a warning to others.

If you want to know what you get a decent coder tries to write an Othello program from scratch
in about 16 hours straight (all night) for tournament the next day this is it.

What can I say, it could be worse.

I had to make a few very minor changes to reduce warnings from ridiculous to just awful.

BTW: This program did not win, or even place, but it's never been beaten by a human since about 6 hours
or so into its development which I guess tells you something about how hard Othello is.  Also it ran *much*
slower on some slice of a VAX 780.  These days it's ridiculously fast but originally I was lucky to evaluate
500 boards/sec.

This directory has the original code with minimal changes.  In the parent directory I will add comments and modernize.
